list = [1,2,3]
file = "mylist.pkl"
fileobj = open(file,'wb')
pickle.dump(list,fileobj)
fileobj.close()

loading -
file = "mylist.pkl"
fileobj = open(file,'rb')
mylist - pickle.load(fileobj)
print(mylist)

app = Flask(__name__) - it suggest that if we are in current file then it returns main, else it returns name of the python script

@app.route('/') - if we are in the current directory
